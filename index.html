        <p class="title-text">Bitcoin Bull Market Support Band</p>
        <h3 class="subtitle-text">20230525 - Benjamin Cowen</h3>

            <p>The crypto market analyst discusses the current support band for Bitcoin, which ranges from around $25,534 to $25,636. He compares the current momentum to that of 2019 and 2015, noting that Bitcoin is currently above the support band but may test it soon. The analyst points out that Bitcoin dominance is still well above the support band and trending higher, indicating a bullish trend. However, he notes that there are some momentum indicators that are starting to be weak, such as the weekly close below the 10 week and the daily close below the 100 day. The analyst suggests that there may be a summer lull in price action, similar to 2019, and that there could be a potential push higher but also a good chance of falling below the support band. The altcoin market is bleeding to Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are considered the Blue Chips of the cryptoverse. The analyst presents two scenarios: if Bitcoin holds the 20 week SMA and bounces, the dominance would likely go up a lot; if it falls below the support band, the altcoin market would bleed profusely against Bitcoin. The analyst advises investors to be cautious and consider the relative safety of the Blue Chips in times of economic uncertainty. 

The analyst notes that historically, in pre-halving years, there is typically a mix of green and red months, and that the latter half of the year is often reserved for fading moves. The analyst warns of meme coin rallies that can often happen in pre-halving years, and that Bitcoin has a way of punishing them. The analyst suggests that if Bitcoin sniffs out that too much liquidity is flowing into meme coins that provide no utility, it will punish them. The analyst also notes that Ethereum has been putting in a series of lower highs, and that May often marks a local high for the Ether Bitcoin pair. The analyst suggests that if Bitcoin breaks below the 20-week SMA, the dominance should go up, and that historically, when Bitcoin breaks below the 20-week SMA, the altcoin market bleeds profusely against Bitcoin. 

The altcoin market has nowhere to hide, and the dominance should go up either way. The analyst warns that there are some momentum indicators that are starting to be weak, and that there is a chance that this move is just being faded and the altcoin market gets wrecked. The analyst advises investors to be cautious and consider the relative safety of the Blue Chips in times of economic uncertainty. The analyst notes that the dollar is back above its 20-week SMA and potentially forming a double bottom, which could be a lower high. The analyst suggests that liquidity flowing from higher risk assets to lower risk assets for a certain period of time can help support the USD valuations of the lower risk assets, but at some point, when the Blue Chips are all over, the altcoin market gets even more wrecked because they already have so little liquidity. This is how the altcoin market gets wrecked no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD, and it's also why the Bitcoin dominance should go higher.</p>

        <p class="title-text">These 8 Altcoins Just Flipped The Crypto Market</p>

            <p>Lark Davis, a crypto market analyst, discusses eight altcoins that are currently flipping the market, including Ethereum and Cardano. He highlights the explosion of stake rates for Ethereum and believes this will draw a lot of money into the coin. Davis is bullish on Ethereum due to major factors happening in the background, including the fact that there are 20.5 million Ethereum staking, and the cue to get in is weeks long. He warns that investing in altcoins is risky and provides a disclosure statement. Davis also discusses the recent news that could act as catalysts for these coins and potentially kick off bigger narratives in the market. For Cardano, Davis mentions the release of their Hydra upgrade, which is a big deal and critical for Cardano's growth moving forward. Davis also talks about Moonbeam, which is Polkadot's answer to Ethereum, and how UniSwap is coming to the Moonbeam blockchain. He discusses Lido Finance, the biggest liquid staking platform for staked Ethereum, and their V2 upgrade, which now allows users to withdraw their Ethereum. Davis also mentions Layer 2 Optimism's firm release date for their big Bedrock upgrade, which could be a real game changer for Optimism. He talks about Curve Finance, the most important stable swap protocol in the crypto industry, and their CRV USD stablecoin, which could drive serious revenue back into the hands of CRV token stakers. Finally, Davis discusses two other coins that could benefit massively from Apple's upcoming headset release, Render and Axie Infinity.</p>

            <p>Crypto market analyst Ran Neuner advises investors to sell their altcoins and invest in Bitcoin infrastructure instead. He believes that Bitcoin is entering a new dimension with the introduction of smart contracts and the ability to run a Bitcoin virtual machine, which presents a huge opportunity for investors to speculate on the innovation being built on the Bitcoin ecosystem. Neuner recommends paying attention to altcoins that are outperforming Bitcoin, such as XRP, Litecoin, and Render, and sees potential in the gaming industry due to the upcoming release of virtual reality and augmented reality glasses by Apple. He also believes that the narratives in the cryptocurrency market are changing, with old school coins like Litecoin coming to life and gaming apps being developed on Bitcoin. The analyst has been successful in calling the market in the past and sees something new happening.</p>

        <p class="title-text">Bitcoin Flashes Major Warning Sign Was This A Bull Trap All Along</p>

            <p>Nicholas Merton, a crypto market analyst, warns that the current rally in cryptocurrency prices is likely a massive liquidity trap relief rally that will slowly fade over time. He points to the lack of sustained momentum on the monthly timeframe and the absence of a blue flip on the momentum indicator as evidence that the rally is not sustainable. Merton also notes that the altcoin market is not showing signs of a risk-on mentality, and the total market cap for the entire crypto space has declined by almost $200 billion from the peak in April 2023. He advises investors to ride the broader waves of momentum and to know when to step away from the party when the momentum starts to stall. 

Merton highlights that the lackluster performance of the market price is not just limited to crypto but is also playing out in equities. He argues that the pressures of higher interest rates and monetary tightening on the balance sheet, both in the United States and central banks across the globe, will squeeze the price performance of financial assets. Merton warns that the global contraction of liquidity will weigh down asset prices, and investors should take a protective stance on their capital. Institutional capital is not driving the rally in crypto, and the lack of dollar liquidity in the crypto space, banking connections for the crypto space, and regulators' pressure on stable coin on-ramps are all contributing to the decline in the crypto market.

Merton also points out that the US consumer has been using credit cards to prop up their spending against the wave of inflation, and credit card debt in the first quarter of 2023 stands nearly at $1 trillion, up almost 20% from a year ago. As bank credit card rates surge higher, along with the federal funds rate, delinquency rates for credit card loans are likely to increase. Merton predicts that by the next year or so, delinquency rates for credit card debt will rise to the 3.5% to 4% range, leading to a tightening economy where credit is getting more and more expensive. 

Given this context, Merton advises investors to be prepared and willing to stomach the market downturn. He believes that the last thing someone would want to touch during this period of time is a high-risk asset like Bitcoin, not to mention altcoins. Merton recommends a passive investing strategy of having exposure towards a broad basket of assets, especially large caps, which is where liquidity is more likely to flow towards than their established plays. He warns that global liquidity is likely to stall or contract over the next year or two, and with that, investors should expect that Bitcoin is likely going for new lows.</p>

        <p class="title-text">Bitcoin: Year-To-Date ROI</p>
        <h3 class="subtitle-text">20230516 - Benjamin Cowen</h3>
        <button class="hide-button" onclick="toggleSection()">Hide Section</button>
        <div id="section-to-toggle" class="text-container">
            <p>Crypto market analyst Benjamin Cowen discusses the year-to-date return on investment (ROI) for Bitcoin and compares it to previous pre-halving years. He suggests that the pre-halving years tend to be half up and half down, with apathy setting in, and that Bitcoin's price action will likely be contained within the bounds of $12,000 to $35,000 for the duration of this year. Cowen predicts that a secondary scare for Bitcoin will occur sometime between Q3 of this year and Q1 of next year, similar to what has been seen in previous cycles. He advises investors to expect a fairly dull year with some price movement to the upside and downside, but not to expect rallies to new highs this year.</p>
