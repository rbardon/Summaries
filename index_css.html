            <p class="summary-content">The crypto market analyst discusses the contraction in the money supply or M2, which is currently negative at 4.63% year-over-year. When adjusted for inflation, M2 is down over 9% year-over-year, which is more negative than it has been on this chart. The analyst emphasizes the importance of understanding the rate of change in the money supply and the difference between disinflation and deflation. The current contraction in the money supply could have significant implications for investors in the cryptocurrency market. The analyst suggests that investors should consider the implications of the current contraction in the money supply and adjust their investment strategies accordingly. The contraction in the money supply could have a headwind effect on asset prices, but there is also a glass half full approach to this as well. The economy recognizes the need to get back to trend, and there is still plenty of wiggle room for us to come back down and get back to trend. The analyst argues that when you don't adjust for inflation, it certainly seems like we're well above Trend, but if you adjust for inflation, we're not that far above Trend. The inherent risk is if the contraction continues to go down and becomes increasingly negative, it could be a strong headwind for risk assets. The analyst notes that the highest M2 went before the negative 6.5% move in the 1970s and 1980s was around 7.93%, while the highest it went in recent times was 24.75%. The analyst suggests that investors should consider the implications of the current contraction in the money supply and adjust their investment strategies accordingly.</p>

            <p class="summary-content">DD, a crypto market analyst, predicts that Bitcoin's price will continue to decline due to faltering narratives driving the bull market and the bleeding altcoin market. He warns that the AI narrative is overshadowing the crypto space, and if crypto cannot keep up with the AI trend, it could be a problem for investing in crypto. DD believes that Bitcoin will reach lower levels, which will attract long-term accumulation from large-scale investors and drive a broader rally over the next few years. DD advises investors to have some exposure to Nvidia if they want to bet on AI being a big thing, but it should not be a substantial amount of their portfolio. <br><br>DD believes that the altcoin market has some gems that will make it through and recommends Radix as a promising layer one protocol. Radix has launched its programming language, Scripto, and has built a community of developers around it that would give real-time feedback. Radix has seen a significant increase in the number of developers, with over 12,000 unique developers who have tried playing around with Scripto. DD advises investors to keep an eye on Radix and its developing ecosystem, as it has the potential to be a game-changer in the crypto space. Radix's upcoming major upgrade, Babylon, is set to launch on July 31st, and DD believes that the slow approach to engineering taken by Radix has been beneficial in making careful architecture decisions. Babylon will fix smart contracts running on Radix and is a significant milestone for the project. DD recommends investors to consider investing in Radix and to keep an eye on its developing ecosystem. <br><br>DD is excited about the next upgrade and believes that Radix has been patient and time-tested about it. He advises investors to keep an eye on Radix's developing ecosystem and to consider investing in it. The launch of Babylon is not a big bang event, and people should be cautious when a brand new protocol goes live. However, he believes that the Radix wallet plus the applications that are going live will finally provide an opportunity for people to recommend the crypto space to their friends. DD advises investors to focus on the trillion-dollar plus opportunity of deep AI coming in and establishing itself, and to consider investing in Radix, which has a developer-centric focus and provides resources to people who want to build real value and real applications.</p>

            <p class="summary-content">The crypto market analyst discusses the current state of the market, with altcoins taking a significant hit. They analyze Bitcoin's weekly chart and identify important moving averages, with potential support levels between 25,000 and 25,500. The analyst also discusses potential long positions and a bounce off the support zone. They mention the stock market breaking down and re-testing resistance levels, which could lead to lower prices. The analyst also discusses the potential impact of the DXY on risk-on assets, with a target of 105.79 for the DXY. The total market cap is moving down towards a target of 1.022 trillion dollars, with potential for a bounce. The analyst warns of the possibility of a triple bottom if the DXY rolls over, leading to a decrease in support levels. The analyst provides insights for potential trades and highlights the importance of monitoring key levels and indicators. The DXY is expected to have a real expansive move once it crosses Target 2 at 105.79, which could impact Bitcoin's position. The analyst advises caution and monitoring of the DXY's movements, as a potential rollover could lead to a triple bottom and decreased support levels. The analyst provides updates on various coins, including Litecoin, Chainlink, AVAX, Dot, and Cardano, and advises waiting for proper swing failure patterns and breakout structures before making trades. The analyst discusses the potential for a "power of three" scenario on Bitcoin, with a potential deviation or swing failure pattern back into the prior range high at 25,000. The analyst provides a trade idea for a potential long setup on Bitcoin, with an entry at 26,215 and a stop at 25,798. The analyst notes the importance of monitoring leveraged traders and their stops, with liquidity towards the upside and potential for a deviation back into the range. The analyst advises caution and monitoring of the potential bearish retest and rejection from the prior range low, which could lead to a fall in price. The trade idea involves a potential range between 26,553 and 29,989, with a take profit at 27,145 and 27,800. The analyst advises adding to the position if price comes back down towards the wick and cutting the position if there is a bearish retest and rejection from the prior range low.</p>

            <p class="summary-content">The crypto market analyst CB notes that China's stance on crypto is shifting, with recent developments such as the broadcast of crypto on China Central Television Station and Hong Kong's announcement to legalize crypto trading to retail on June 1st. This could lead to a capital shift from the US into other nations, particularly in Asia, as they see it as an opportunity to attract web 3 talent. China is launching a blockchain initiative via its Research Center to train blockchain professionals, aiming to establish a national level blockchain network that will connect existing blockchains in China and support other industries. The Chinese city of Nanjing is launching a government-backed metaverse program, aiming to create a thriving industry with annual revenue surpassing $135 billion by the close of 2025. The analyst is monitoring Chinese coins and coins listed in Hong Kong, as well as the market psychology and investor mind share as a proxy bet for that nation.<br><br>The analyst believes that regional investing in crypto can be a valid approach to capture exposure of the upside of a nation. The next Bull Run could be triggered by China starting to open up its doors to crypto and make its stance more lenient towards crypto. However, the analyst is wary of Bitcoin's bearish diagonal sloping trend and recommends caution until a confirmed break of the zone occurs. The analyst suggests that Prime xbt offers a variety of trading pairs, including altcoins, Forex pairs, commodities, and stocks.<br><br>Regarding Ethereum, the analyst notes that it is still hovering above its horizontal support, but Bitcoin has started to break down on the daily below its horizontal support. The analyst recommends a stop loss around the 1750 Zone for a long scenario, and a short setup could be considered if Ethereum breaks below and has a retest of the previous Range High. The analyst suggests using the ETH chart in Confluence with the weaker altcoins on their ETH pairs or BTC pairs to short the weakest alt.<br><br>The potential of a Bitcoin dominance breakdown could lead to a mini alt run, but it is wishful thinking as it would require Bitcoin to perform in that scenario. The top performers recently include Marumaru NFT, Axie Infinity, Holobi Sandbox, Decentraland, and Matagala, with some strong metaverse tailwinds. The analyst recommends looking at AI and metaverse coins for long opportunities, as they have shown relative strength in the market. Trading on-chain is highly recommended, as it provides a better learning experience and knowledge in crypto. The analyst suggests using G trade for trading on-chain, as it has low fees on arbitrum, quick execution, and composability. <br><br>In conclusion, the analyst recommends caution in the current market due to Bitcoin's bearish trend and suggests regional investing in crypto to capture exposure to the upside of a nation. The analyst also recommends looking at AI and metaverse coins for long opportunities and trading on-chain using G trade.</p>

            <p class="summary-content">The crypto market analyst discusses the current support band for Bitcoin, which ranges from around $25,534 to $25,636. He compares the current momentum to that of 2019 and 2015, noting that Bitcoin is currently above the support band but may test it soon. The analyst points out that Bitcoin dominance is still well above the support band and trending higher, indicating a bullish trend. However, he notes that there are some momentum indicators that are starting to be weak, such as the weekly close below the 10 week and the daily close below the 100 day. The analyst suggests that there may be a summer lull in price action, similar to 2019, and that there could be a potential push higher but also a good chance of falling below the support band. The altcoin market is bleeding to Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are considered the Blue Chips of the cryptoverse. The analyst presents two scenarios: if Bitcoin holds the 20 week SMA and bounces, the dominance would likely go up a lot; if it falls below the support band, the altcoin market would bleed profusely against Bitcoin. The analyst advises investors to be cautious and consider the relative safety of the Blue Chips in times of economic uncertainty. <br><br>The analyst notes that historically, in pre-halving years, there is typically a mix of green and red months, and that the latter half of the year is often reserved for fading moves. The analyst warns of meme coin rallies that can often happen in pre-halving years, and that Bitcoin has a way of punishing them. The analyst suggests that if Bitcoin sniffs out that too much liquidity is flowing into meme coins that provide no utility, it will punish them. The analyst also notes that Ethereum has been putting in a series of lower highs, and that May often marks a local high for the Ether Bitcoin pair. The analyst suggests that if Bitcoin breaks below the 20-week SMA, the dominance should go up, and that historically, when Bitcoin breaks below the 20-week SMA, the altcoin market bleeds profusely against Bitcoin. <br><br>The altcoin market has nowhere to hide, and the dominance should go up either way. The analyst warns that there are some momentum indicators that are starting to be weak, and that there is a chance that this move is just being faded and the altcoin market gets wrecked. The analyst advises investors to be cautious and consider the relative safety of the Blue Chips in times of economic uncertainty. The analyst notes that the dollar is back above its 20-week SMA and potentially forming a double bottom, which could be a lower high. The analyst suggests that liquidity flowing from higher risk assets to lower risk assets for a certain period of time can help support the USD valuations of the lower risk assets, but at some point, when the Blue Chips are all over, the altcoin market gets even more wrecked because they already have so little liquidity. This is how the altcoin market gets wrecked no matter the direction of Bitcoin USD, and it's also why the Bitcoin dominance should go higher.</p>

            <p class="summary-content">The crypto market analyst suggests that the current pullback in the market could be a good buying opportunity for Bitcoin, but emphasizes the importance of focusing on the correct altcoin trades during this time. The Weekly RSI is getting to the bottom, which could be the best time to dollar cost into portfolios. The market may range for a while, and there could be a slighter lower low than what was previously hit. If the price drops to the 25,000 level, it could be a good buying opportunity for a short-term bounce. However, if there is no higher high after that, it may indicate a bigger move. The analyst emphasizes the importance of having a balanced portfolio and being prepared for either scenario. <br><br>The analyst recommends focusing on Litecoin, Render, and Carver for potential trades. The analyst advises investors to zoom out and evaluate their long-term portfolio, getting rid of bad entries and improving the good ones. The analyst suggests that Render and Carver are good trades to focus on, with Render being an explosive token in the bull markets and Carver showing good volume and interest. The analyst also recommends focusing on XRP, which is forming a trend and could have a higher low if Bitcoin holds the 25,000 level. <br><br>The analyst suggests that fixing bad entries or getting rid of them is crucial for success in the upcoming bull market. The analyst also advises investors to focus on coins with good volume and interest, such as Cardano and Super Farm. The analyst believes that the bull market has already started and investors should be prepared for a potential explosive move in the market. <br><br>The analyst provides insights on potential short-term trades, such as BNB, Phantom, GRT, CFX, and Injective. The analyst suggests that BNB could fall hard if the market turns bearish, and recommends shorting it if it closes below the 300 mark on the daily chart. The analyst advises investors to de-risk on Phantom due to the current market conditions, and suggests buying at around 28 to 30 cents for the long-term portfolio. The analyst also recommends buying DYDX at the 1.8 to 2 dollar range, and buying Luxo at the 8 to 9 dollar range for an inverse head and shoulders play. The analyst suggests that CFX could be a good trading coin, with a potential 30 to 40 trade to the upside if it breaks the top of the flag formation. The analyst also recommends buying Injective at the 6 dollar range, with a potential buy opportunity at the 4.5 to 5 dollar range if Bitcoin drops to 22,000. <br><br>The analyst believes that new tokens will be the ones that explode in the next bull market, and recommends Lido as a potential investment, with a predicted price range of 1.6 to 1.8.

While there is a short-term possibility of Bitcoin going down to the 23-24k range, there is a much larger inverse Head and Shoulders pattern that could lead to a significant breakout. The analyst also notes that the hash rate has over 2xed its prior May 2021 high, indicating a strong and robust network. The analyst believes that if the macro bearish sentiment fades, Bitcoin's price will catch up quickly. The analyst argues that Bitcoin's potential for growth and adoption is still high, despite the possibility of lower returns in the next bull market. The analyst points out that Bitcoin's adoption can increase exponentially, leading to a fundamental difference in its growth compared to previous markets. The analyst also notes that the current bear market is different from the previous one, as the hash rate has reached new all-time highs, indicating a strong network. The analyst believes that a jump to 35-40k, or even mid-40ks, in a short amount of time is possible, as the macro bearish sentiment fades. The analyst highlights that Bitcoin has behaved well when banks start failing, and the risk to reward of being very bearish on Bitcoin is a costly mistake. The analyst argues that Bitcoin is overdue for a big move, as it has been in a consolidation range for longer than previous ones. The analyst also notes that the MMI indicator shows an increase in volatility every time Bitcoin comes in contact with a certain line, and Bitcoin has been in that range for about three weeks. The analyst believes that a big move could come within a few days and that the bullish MACD cross on the long-term charts is moments away.</p>

            <p class="summary-content">Lark Davis, a crypto market analyst, discusses eight altcoins that are currently flipping the market, including Ethereum and Cardano. He highlights the explosion of stake rates for Ethereum and believes this will draw a lot of money into the coin. Davis is bullish on Ethereum due to major factors happening in the background, including the fact that there are 20.5 million Ethereum staking, and the cue to get in is weeks long. He warns that investing in altcoins is risky and provides a disclosure statement. Davis also discusses the recent news that could act as catalysts for these coins and potentially kick off bigger narratives in the market. For Cardano, Davis mentions the release of their Hydra upgrade, which is a big deal and critical for Cardano's growth moving forward. Davis also talks about Moonbeam, which is Polkadot's answer to Ethereum, and how UniSwap is coming to the Moonbeam blockchain. He discusses Lido Finance, the biggest liquid staking platform for staked Ethereum, and their V2 upgrade, which now allows users to withdraw their Ethereum. Davis also mentions Layer 2 Optimism's firm release date for their big Bedrock upgrade, which could be a real game changer for Optimism. He talks about Curve Finance, the most important stable swap protocol in the crypto industry, and their CRV USD stablecoin, which could drive serious revenue back into the hands of CRV token stakers. Finally, Davis discusses two other coins that could benefit massively from Apple's upcoming headset release, Render and Axie Infinity.</p>

            <p class="summary-content">Nicholas Merton, a crypto market analyst, warns that the current rally in cryptocurrency prices is likely a massive liquidity trap relief rally that will slowly fade over time. He points to the lack of sustained momentum on the monthly timeframe and the absence of a blue flip on the momentum indicator as evidence that the rally is not sustainable. Merton also notes that the altcoin market is not showing signs of a risk-on mentality, and the total market cap for the entire crypto space has declined by almost $200 billion from the peak in April 2023. He advises investors to ride the broader waves of momentum and to know when to step away from the party when the momentum starts to stall. <br><br>Merton highlights that the lackluster performance of the market price is not just limited to crypto but is also playing out in equities. He argues that the pressures of higher interest rates and monetary tightening on the balance sheet, both in the United States and central banks across the globe, will squeeze the price performance of financial assets. Merton warns that the global contraction of liquidity will weigh down asset prices, and investors should take a protective stance on their capital. Institutional capital is not driving the rally in crypto, and the lack of dollar liquidity in the crypto space, banking connections for the crypto space, and regulators' pressure on stable coin on-ramps are all contributing to the decline in the crypto market.<br><br>Merton also points out that the US consumer has been using credit cards to prop up their spending against the wave of inflation, and credit card debt in the first quarter of 2023 stands nearly at $1 trillion, up almost 20% from a year ago. As bank credit card rates surge higher, along with the federal funds rate, delinquency rates for credit card loans are likely to increase. Merton predicts that by the next year or so, delinquency rates for credit card debt will rise to the 3.5% to 4% range, leading to a tightening economy where credit is getting more and more expensive. <br><br>Given this context, Merton advises investors to be prepared and willing to stomach the market downturn. He believes that the last thing someone would want to touch during this period of time is a high-risk asset like Bitcoin, not to mention altcoins. Merton recommends a passive investing strategy of having exposure towards a broad basket of assets, especially large caps, which is where liquidity is more likely to flow towards than their established plays. He warns that global liquidity is likely to stall or contract over the next year or two, and with that, investors should expect that Bitcoin is likely going for new lows.</p>

            <p class="summary-content">The crypto market analyst discusses the worst-case scenario for the cryptocurrency asset class, acknowledging that while some believe it could go to zero, he does not consider that realistic. He notes that the asset class remains under pressure from macro headwinds and cyclical indicators, but believes it will eventually go back into a bull market. The analyst reminds investors to be realistic and objective, rather than blindly optimistic, and to be selective in choosing altcoins. He draws comparisons between the crypto bubble and the dot-com bubble, noting that while not all altcoins will recover, the projects that will be integrated into society are currently being worked on within the cryptocurrency asset class. <br><br>The worst-case scenario for the cryptocurrency asset class is plausible, and investors should be cautious in their investments. The analyst suggests that the entire asset class going below $500 billion is possible, which would be akin to what the.com bubble did. He suggests that investors should be prepared for this potential scenario and that they should watch closely to see what happens. If the asset class drops another 20% from its current level, but not the full extension from the all-time high, and then gets a 60% rally back up to $1 trillion, that could be the rally to watch. <br><br>The analyst notes that the cryptocurrency asset class has already seen a 50% haircut from its previous high, and that it could potentially go lower. He suggests that there are similarities between the dot-com bubble and the current crypto market, including three main rallies, each one more aggressive than the one that preceded it. He warns that the bottom may not be in yet, and that investors should be prepared for potential cyclical indicators for Bitcoin that are coming up soon. <br><br>The analyst suggests that if the total cryptocurrency market cap were to fall 84%, it would put the asset class at around $400-500 billion, including stable coins. He draws parallels between the dot-com bubble and the current crypto market, noting that the combined market values of the.com stocks peaked at $2.948 trillion, while crypto peaked at around $3 trillion. He warns that the asset class could go down 84%, which would put it at around $400-500 billion, and that investors should be cautious and realistic in their approach to the cryptocurrency market. <br><br>The analyst suggests that if the worst-case scenario occurs, deep value could be obtained within the asset class, regardless of whether it's the bottom. He notes that historical bottoms tend to be retested, and that investors should be prepared for potential cyclical indicators for Bitcoin that are coming up soon. He suggests that whether it's the bottom or not will depend on how low it goes, and that if it goes a lot lower than 20% from its current level, the case for the bottom could be made. However, if it's not, investors should still be on their toes and assume that it could still take a while to play out.</p>

            <p class="summary-content">The crypto market analyst discusses the current downtrend in Bitcoin and the negative market sentiment due to unmet expectations of a parabolic move in Q4. However, the analyst believes that there is still a chance for a lengthened market cycle and the key focus is on whether Bitcoin can break the downtrend. The analyst looks at trend lines and the daily RSI to identify potential breakouts and notes that the 50-week estimate and the 200-day moving average are key areas of resistance to watch. A break above 49.5k could signal a temporary break in the downtrend. The 200-day moving average is a key area to watch, as it is currently coming in at around 47.2k and has been a level of resistance since the beginning of September. The analyst suggests that if Bitcoin can break the downtrend and put in a new higher high at least at 49.5k, it could be trying to build out a base rather than immediately continue the downtrend. Overall, the analyst advises caution and not to get too excited about micro pumps until an uptrend is established.</p>

            <p class="summary-content">The crypto market analyst discusses the recent drop in Bitcoin's price and looks at key milestones and support levels. He notes that Bitcoin has bounced off the 100-day moving average in the past and suggests that a bounce at this level would be the most optimistic scenario. He also looks at a linear scale and notes the confluence between the daily moving averages and the bull market support band, suggesting that even if Bitcoin drops to 52-53k, it is still doing relatively well. The analyst mentions the short-term bubble risk, which is not as extended as it was in April, and notes that the 50-week moving average is moving higher and could provide support. The analyst suggests that while many people are worried about the market, Bitcoin is still above major support levels and there is still some wiggle room. The analyst also notes that the 20-week moving average is not too far extended from the current price, and that there is a lot of support at the 100-day, 20-week, and bull market support band levels. Even if Bitcoin were to drop below the bull market support band, there is still a chance to get back above it, as has happened in the past. The 50-week moving average is also moving higher and could provide support. The analyst remains optimistic about the market and suggests that this phase could emulate the second leg of the 2017 market cycle, with systematic tests of the bull market support band. The analyst suggests that the area to bounce from is 52-53k if the 100-day moving average does not hold at 54.5k.</p>

            <p class="summary-content">The crypto market analyst believes that the current market is in a long re-accumulation phase similar to the summer of 2020, but not as attractive as the previous accumulation phase. However, the analyst does not believe that it is a double top and expects the market cycle to lengthen. The analyst emphasizes the importance of using data rather than emotions to make investment decisions and urges caution and technical correctness before claiming victory. The analyst argues that the current market resembles the first leg of the 2013 market cycle and there is a strong possibility that the second leg of the cycle will resemble the 2017 move. The analyst believes that a systematic test of the 20-week SMA for a few weeks or months off and on is better because it is a slower move up and more sustainable. The analyst is excited for what 2022 has in store and believes that the whole year of 2021 has been accumulation from 30k to 60k. The analyst urges cryptocurrency investors to be patient and practice risk management.</p>

            <p class="summary-content">The crypto market analyst discusses the current state of the market and suggests that it is bearish, as it is below the bull market support band. He advises investors to consider downside risk and have stable coins on the sideline to DCA into the market if things get bearish. He suggests that the 50-week SMA could offer support if the market continues to correct. The analyst warns against being deterministic about any outcome and suggests that investors prepare for every situation. He argues that the evidence for a 300k bitcoin by the end of the year is non-existent and that investors should consider potential downside scenarios. He suggests that the 50-week SMA could be an area to look at, which is around 28k, if the market continues to trend down. He also mentions the 100-week and 200-week moving averages as potential areas of support. The analyst advises investors to have some stable coins on the sideline to DCA into the market if things are bearish for a little while. He warns against being deterministic about things and suggests having some flexibility. The analyst concludes that things look bearish to him, and investors need to stop operating deterministically and assuming that the market will always go up.</p>

            <p class="summary-content">The crypto market analyst argues that Bitcoin investors still have time on their side and that the market cycle top has not yet been reached. The analyst uses charts to show that the return on investment (ROI) of Bitcoin from the halving suggests that there is still potential for a 30x return this cycle. The analyst acknowledges that corrections may occur, but that Bitcoin has historically continued to rise despite them. The evidence suggests that the peak of this cycle is still a ways off and that more institutions need to come into the market to drive the price higher. The analyst believes that the probability of being at a market cycle top is very low and that the probability of being at a local top that consolidates for a few months is higher. The analyst also notes that the corrections this cycle have been somewhat tame compared to the last cycle, and that investors should not be phased by larger corrections. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization logarithmic regression trend line and the fair value overvaluation extension suggest that time is on the side of investors. While it may be challenging for Bitcoin to reach $310,000 by the end of the year, the analyst believes that those who are patient and ride the wave for years to come will have the most gain in the grand scheme of the market cycle.</p>
