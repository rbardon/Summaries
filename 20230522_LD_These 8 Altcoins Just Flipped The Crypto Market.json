He highlights the explosion of stake rates for Ethereum and believes this will draw a lot of money into the coin. Davis is bullish on Ethereum due to major factors happening in the background, including the fact that there are 20.5 million Ethereum staking, and the cue to get in is weeks long. He warns that investing in altcoins is risky and provides a disclosure statement. Davis also discusses the recent news that could act as catalysts for these coins and potentially kick off bigger narratives in the market. For Cardano, Davis mentions the release of their Hydra upgrade, which is a big deal and critical for Cardano's growth moving forward. Davis also talks about Moonbeam, which is Polkadot's answer to Ethereum, and how UniSwap is coming to the Moonbeam blockchain. He discusses Lido Finance, the biggest liquid staking platform for staked Ethereum, and their V2 upgrade, which now allows users to withdraw their Ethereum. Davis also mentions Layer 2 Optimism's firm release date for their big Bedrock upgrade, which could be a real game changer for Optimism. He talks about Curve Finance, the most important stable swap protocol in the crypto industry, and their CRV USD stablecoin, which could drive serious revenue back into the hands of CRV token stakers. Finally, Davis discusses two other coins that could benefit massively from Apple's upcoming headset release, Render and Axie Infinity."}
