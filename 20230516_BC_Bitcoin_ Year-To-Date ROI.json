He suggests that the pre-halving years tend to be half up and half down, with apathy setting in, and that Bitcoin's price action will likely be contained within the bounds of $12,000 to $35,000 for the duration of this year. Cowen predicts that a secondary scare for Bitcoin will occur sometime between Q3 of this year and Q1 of next year, similar to what has been seen in previous cycles. He advises investors to expect a fairly dull year with some price movement to the upside and downside, but not to expect rallies to new highs this year.", "audio_file": "20230516_BC_Bitcoin_ Year-To-Date ROI.mp3", "tokens_in_transcript": 1967, "channel": "Benjamin Cowen"}
